    <p> This page contains resources and talks that I find inspirational and informative. It is important as people in
        the field of computing that we understand our roots, so we can understand that there are many ways to approach
        computing, and what passes for 'best practice' in our field is very often just dogma. </p>

                <i>Inventing on Principle.</i><br/><br/>
                Simply the best talk I've seen in the last few years.

                <b>Richard Hamming</b><br/>
                <i>You and your research</i><br/><br/>
                Hamming is both a genius and a masterful communicator, and his
                work on coding theory is indispensable. This lecture is not technical, rather it is about adopting a
                mindset of excellence.

            <td><b>Alan Kay</b><br/>
                <i>Normal Considered Harmful</i><br/><br/>
                Dr Kay is the man who is both most visionary about how computers
                ought to
                behave in concert with man, and the most cynical about how the industry is today. The combination is
                delightful.

                <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.</i><br/><br/>
                This is lecture 1 of a course taught along with Gerald Jay Sussman
                but you should really watch the entire series. Although lecture 1 will give you more insight into
                computer science than anything else you could ever watch
