    I enjoy learning new programming languages (my current favorite is <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>),
    and subscribe to the vision of computer science as spelled out in Abelson and Sussman's seminal course, <a
        href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/">Structure
    and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> - computer science is really about formalizing the specification of
    how-to knowledge, in the same way that mathematics is about formalizing declarative knowledge. I am a computer
    history afficionado.

        Perhaps the central problem we face in all of computer science is how we are to get to the situation where we
        build on top of the work of others rather than redoing so much of it in a trivially different way.

        Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for computers to understand.
