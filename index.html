    I enjoy learning new programming languages (my current favorite is <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>), and subscribe to the vision of computer science as spelled out in Abelson and Sussman's seminal course, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> - computer science is really about formalizing the specification of how-to knowledge, in the same way that mathematics is about formalizing declarative knowledge.

      God wrote in Lisp code
      When he filled the leaves with green.
      The fractal flowers and recursive roots:
      The most lovely hack I've seen.</i>
