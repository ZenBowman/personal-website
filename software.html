    <p><a href="http://www.github.com/zenbowman/Roop">Roop</a> is a language and integrated development environment for
        image processing and computer vision, built on top of OpenCV. It is being built primarily as a tool for teaching
        myself the concepts of vision and image processing, but could potentially be used as a tool for trying out
        different ideas in the image processing domain. The IDE in particular tries to adopt Bret Victor's principle of
        providing the language writer with immediate feedback, with the computer playing the role of algorithm
        development assistant rather than a dumb machine that follows orders.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.github.com/zenbowman/slickint">slickint</a> is a tool to help quickly construct interfaces to
        database using Scala's Slick library. It supports the automatic creation of case classes (including for tables
        with more than 22 columns) from a compact description of the table.</p>
